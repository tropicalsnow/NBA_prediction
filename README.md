Prediction of NBA games and suite of tools for bet placement in Betfair exchange

This is something I have been working on and off for the last 3-4 years.

Python code for prediction of NBA game outcomes, scraping of games data and market odds and calculation of bet stakes (wagers) based on a variety of different betting strategies.

I do not have the time to work on this any more so if anyone could benefit from using this, you are welcome.

Also includes data (in SQLite format) from the 1950s-2021
